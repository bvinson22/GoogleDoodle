# My Topic Google Doodle

50+ words about your Google Doodle.

I had a rough start for my google doodle. I started out importing PNG instead of SVG but once I figured it out it actually was easier than I was making it. I really love Disney so I decided to create a doodle that featured the Mickey balloons. This is only the start of my doodle and I would love to be able to animate it so that the ballons lift up the word Google from the bottom and then I can create a cool hover animation that changed to color or design to the word google.
